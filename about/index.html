I have <a href=https://www.richardlupton.com>another site</a> here which is more mixed in content, although it also contains quite a bit of technical content.</p><p>I created <a href=https://github.com/Metaswitch/floki>floki</a> in my prior role, and still maintain it alongside Max Dymond. It replaces the numerous <code>run_docker.sh</code> scripts that are typically included in repositories with containerised builds.</p><p>I currently work at Google as a software engineer in SRE, doing my bit to keep the Google networks running. Prior to this I worked at Metaswitch, predominantly on a SIP SBC and a SIP loadbalancer.</p><p>My prior training is in mathematics, researching Analytic Topology and it&rsquo;s interactions with Set Theory. I did my undergraduate and PhD at Oxford University.</p><p>I originally taught myself to program in C around the age of 11 or 12. I like working on high-performance and constrained systems, as well as thinking about problems at a more abstract level. This means I like working in many languages, from C and Rust to Haskell.</p></div><div id=footer><a href=https://github.com/rlupton20><img class=nav-icon src=https://rlupton20.github.io/icons/github.svg></a></div></body></html>
