I started from a text only interface - the bare minimum of packages - and installed the rest by hand. For reasons that aren&rsquo;t entirely clear, the default font rendering is pretty hideous. It took me a while to track down how to properly configure font rendering. Perhaps this isn&rsquo;t an issue for installs which include a desktop from the get go. If it is, maybe this can help. While I did this on Debian, there isn&rsquo;t much Debian specific - I&rsquo;ve opted for the text file editing approach to configuration instead of strange menu-driven or ncurses stuff. This allows me to version the configuration or do automation work later.</p><h1 id=the-very-short-version>The very short version</h1><p>Enter the following into <code>/home/user/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf</code>.</p><pre><code class=language-xml>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM &quot;fonts.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;fontconfig&gt;

  &lt;!-- Enable antialiasing for all fonts --&gt;
  &lt;match target=&quot;font&quot;&gt;
    &lt;edit mode=&quot;assign&quot; name=&quot;antialias&quot;&gt;
      &lt;bool&gt;true&lt;/bool&gt;
    &lt;/edit&gt;
  &lt;/match&gt;

&lt;/fontconfig&gt;
</code></pre><p>Restart an application (firefox, virtual terminal) to see the changes. For me, just adding anti-aliasing to font rendering made all the difference. There are more dials to tune, but this was enough to make the font rendering passable.</p><h1 id=beginning-the-art-and-craft-of-debugging-fonts>Beginning the art and craft of debugging fonts</h1><p>I don&rsquo;t know why fonts remain such a painful part of the linux experience. Perhaps it&rsquo;s just me, but figuring out what&rsquo;s going on, and how to configure the font rendering isn&rsquo;t at all obvious. As such, I thought I&rsquo;d make a list for my future self of tools to use to help determine what is going on.</p><ul><li><code>fc-conflist</code> lists all the files which are read to determine font configuration.</li><li><code>xterm</code> launched from a terminal usefully prints out some errors in font configuration (e.g. unrecognised entries). There ought to be a better way than this, but I don&rsquo;t know it (I discovered this by accident).</li><li><code>fc-cache</code> builds font information caches.</li><li><code>fc-list</code> lists all fonts on the system.</li></ul><p>Using these together with restarting a test application can help get the fonts to render as you would like.</p><p>I also noticed taking screenshots was well worthwhile, or at least doing a side-by-side comparison of different settings. I thought my settings had made one program render very strangely compared to previous settings, but direct comparison showed no difference! In fact, anti-aliasing was the only change I made where I could tell the difference in the font rendering (it&rsquo;s possible all other settings I tried were already set in the other configuration files). Now text doesn&rsquo;t look like total garbage.</p><p>At a future point, when I can find the will to do it, I&rsquo;ll tune the rendering further still, and expand these notes.</p></div><div id=footer><a href=https://github.com/rlupton20><img class=nav-icon src=https://rlupton20.github.io/icons/github.svg></a></div></body></html>
