This makes it possible to configure the system to exclude non-free packages, and with the addition of a libre kernel, allows us to turn NixOS into a libre platform. Of course, this isn&rsquo;t the same as leveraging an FSF endorsed distribution, but for those who are happy to maintain and take responsibility for the software running on their systems, it&rsquo;s as good. In fact, it&rsquo;s a little strange that the process of deblobbing normal systems isn&rsquo;t better documented and more widely done, after all, this is exactly what a libre distribution typically is. If you want a libre system out of the box, with nix-y functionality, GuixSD is also worth a look, but I really like NixOS, and I thought it worth the effort to libre-up.</p><p>By default, most non-free packages can&rsquo;t be installed on nixos without explicitly allowing unfree packages. There are a couple of places however where non-free software can be installed. The first is in the standard linux kernel, so our first job is to rebase our system on top of a libre linux build. NixOS does allows packages with the license type <code>unfreeRedistributableFirmware</code>, so the remainder of the work consists of blacklisting this license type.</p><h1 id=installing-a-libre-kernel>Installing a libre kernel</h1><p>The default linux kernel comes with all the binary blobs typically packaged with the linux kernel. NixoOS makes it easy to specify a custom kernel in <code>/etc/nixos/configuration.nix</code>.</p><p>There are three stages to installing a custom kernel build:
- Generate/obtain a kernel build configuration file
- Write the build expression into <code>configuration.nix</code>
- Testing</p><p>Nix will take care of building and installing the kernel for us. It also makes it trivial to reproduce once we&rsquo;ve got the setup we want. Upgrades can be achieved just by updating the source package being pulled.</p><p>Building a kernel takes a little time, so if this is being done on a lot of machines (and once you&rsquo;ve got it working as you like), you may want to set up a custom repository and binary cache for your built kernel, and use this in your <code>configuration.nix</code>. <a href=http://sandervanderburg.blogspot.co.uk/2016/10/push-and-pull-deployment-of-nix-packages.html>This article</a> should help with this, and provide other options for deployment.</p><h2 id=obtaining-your-current-configuration>Obtaining your current configuration</h2><p>We can obtain the configuration file used to build the current kernel using <code>zcat /proc/config.gz</code>. Let&rsquo;s store this in a file alongside <code>configuration.nix</code> and use it to build our libre kernel.</p><pre><code class=language-bash>$ zcat /proc/config.gz | sudo tee /etc/nixos/kernel.config
</code></pre><p>At a later point you could customize this file to adjust the kernel to your needs, or run the configuration tools bundled with the libre kernel to generate a configuration file completely customized to your needs. The above approach however will do to get started.</p><h2 id=specifying-our-new-kernel>Specifying our new kernel</h2><p>Nix will take care of building our kernel properly. We just need to provide enough details in <code>configuration.nix</code>. The following addition to <code>configuration.nix</code> provides all we need to build the 4.12.10 linux-libre kernel in NixOS.</p><pre><code class=language-nix>boot.kernelPackages = pkgs.linuxPackages_custom
  version = &quot;4.12.10-gnu&quot;;
  src = pkgs.fetchurl {
    url = &quot;http://www.linux-libre.fsfla.org/pub/linux-libre/releases/4.12.10-gnu/linux-libre-4.12.10-gnu.tar.xz&quot;;
    sha256 = &quot;122a457b0def2050378359641cce341c4d5f3f3dc70d9c55d58ac82ccfaf361b&quot;;
  };
  configfile = /etc/nixos/kernel.config;
}; 
</code></pre><h2 id=building-and-testing>Building and testing</h2><p>Run <code>nixos-rebuild switch</code> to instantiate your new configuration. You can try out your new kernel and test it works easily, and if there are problems boot into the old working kernel from the bootloader (another nix win). You can roll back to your old configuration with <code>nixos-rebuild switch --rollback</code>.</p><h1 id=blacklisting-unwanted-licenses>Blacklisting unwanted licenses</h1><p><code>nixpkgs</code> can be configured to blacklist certain license types. The <a href=https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/lib/licenses.nix>license definition file</a> lists all the licenses used in all the packages in nix. Anything with <code>free = false;</code> is recognized as a non-free package by nix, and can&rsquo;t be installed unless non-free packages are explicitly enabled. However, there are non-free licenses without this label. <code>unfreeRedistributableFirmware</code> is non-free yet doesn&rsquo;t have this label. To help avoid inadvertantly installing these kinds of packages, we need to blacklist this license (along with any others we want to avoid).</p><h2 id=system-level>System level</h2><p>The following snippet, added to <code>configuration.nix</code> will do the job.</p><pre><code>{ config, pkgs, lib, ... }:
{

  . 
  .
  .

# Block any unfree firmware (which isn't in the kernel)
  nixpkgs.config = {
    blacklistedLicenses = with lib.licenses; [
      unfreeRedistributableFirmware
    ];
  };

  .
  .
  .
};
</code></pre><p>It&rsquo;s also possible to specify a license whitelist, with the option <code>whitelistedLicenses</code>.</p><h2 id=user-level>User level</h2><p><code>nixpkgs</code> configuration at the system level isn&rsquo;t reflected for the users, so users will still by default be able to install non-free packages. User <code>nixpkgs</code> need to be configured separately. At present, the best way to do this is to add</p><pre><code>{
  blacklistedLicenses = with stdenv.lib.licenses; [
	unfreeRedistributableFirmware
  ];
}
</code></pre><p>to <code>~/.config/nixpkgs/config.nix</code>. The <a href=https://nixos.org/nixpkgs/manual/#chap-packageconfig>nixpkgs manual</a> contains information here that&rsquo;s useful.</p><p>If you use a manifest to install packages, you can add these configuration options to your import of <code>nixpkgs</code>. For example:</p><pre><code>  # Define pkgs as &lt;nixpkgs&gt; with some licenses
  # blacklisted
  pkgs = import &lt;nixpkgs&gt; {
    config = {
      blacklistedLicenses = with _licenses; [
        unfreeRedistributableFirmware
      ];
    };
  };
</code></pre><p>Currently, there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a way to add a system wide default for user nixpkgs configuration in the absence of an explicit configuration file, which is unfortunate. This works reasonably, in the meantime, and since firmware is the only non-free software available to users by default, is not as bad as it might seem.</p></div></section><h1 class=content-subhead>11 Sep 2017, 16:00</h1><section class=post><header class=post-header><a href=https://rlupton20.github.io/posts/2017-09-11-lightweight-screenshots-in-xmonad/ class=post-title>Lightweight screenshots in Xmonad</a><p class=post-meta></p></header><div class=post-description><h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p>Xmonad does not come with any kind of screenshot tool (or anything at all much, which in my view is a good thing - what it does do it does well). I didn&rsquo;t want a heavyweight system (something taken from GNOME or XFCE), but wanted some flexibility still. I made a little script which straps together <code>rofi</code>, <code>slop</code>, <code>maim</code> and <code>xclip</code> to provide a lightweight and flexible screenshotting tool. I&rsquo;m posting it here for anyone who is looking for something similar. Add a keybinding in <code>xmonad</code> and off you go! Of course, this will work perfectly well with other window managers too.</p><p>I wanted to be able to do a combination of the following things
1. Capture the whole screen
2. Capture just a section of the screen
3. Possibly capture to clipboard
4. Possibly capture to file
selectable quickly and easily from some kind of popup menu.</p><p>I decided to bind this script to <code>Mod-PrintScr</code>, with <code>PrintScr</code> bound to <code>maim -s -c 1,0,0,0.6 --format png /dev/stdout | tee ~/.screenshots/$(date +%F-%T).png | xclip -selection clipboard -t image/png -i</code> (capture selection to file and clipboard), a default of sorts.</p><h2 id=the-script-explained>The script explained</h2><p>The script is presented below. It is also available <a href=https://github.com/rlupton20/dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/super-screenshot.sh>here</a>. I imagine most people would want to modify it/rewrite it/use it as a basis for their own systems. Chances are, if you like using a tiler, you long lost interest in keeping to &ldquo;sensible defaults&rdquo;. Tweak away!</p><p><code>maim</code> is the main tool here for making screenshots. It can use <code>slop</code> in the background to do selections. <code>xclip</code> provides a way to get captures onto the clipboard. I wanted several options to be selectable when making a screenshot, so I encoded these options in a slightly horrible way into the script (see <code>OPTIONS</code>). The script breaks these down into actual option names that can be fed to <code>rofi</code> (a <code>dmenu</code> like tool - you could use <code>dmenu</code>) using fairly standard *nix sorcery, then uses the selection to extract the parameters from <code>OPTIONS</code> before making the screenshot.</p><p>We use <code>/dev/null</code> as a file when we don&rsquo;t want to actually save to file, and when we do, we create a new file in <code>SCREENSHOT_DIR</code> (with a datestamp) to store the capture in. When we don&rsquo;t want to save to clipboard, we pipe the capture into <code>xclip -h</code>, the help command for <code>xclip</code>. Massive hack, but it works.</p><h2 id=source>Source</h2><pre><code class=language-bash>#!/usr/bin/env bash

Slice refers to what Linux would dub a partition, and partition refers to a Linux “partition of a partition”. Linux’s <code>sda1</code> would therefore be slice <code>0</code> of disk <code>sda</code> (BSD counts from <code>0</code>), which on my BSD system is denoted <code>da0s0</code> (disk 0 slice 0 – first disk first slice).</p><h1 id=introduction>Introduction</h1><p>So first a little background. DragonFly BSD comes with a simple installer that works very well if your disk has an MBR partition table, or takes up the entire disk. The kernel is GPT compatible but the bootloader is not (inspection of the boot1 source code reveals it is exclusively MBR based). This need not be a problem if DragonFly is your only system, or you’re happy with MBR and DragonFly’s boot0 bootloader.</p><p>However, GPT offers many advantages, especially if you would like to dual boot alongside a linux installation, with plenty of slices. I wanted to dual boot alongside Arch linux, and bootload with GRUB2. This is what I’ll outline below.</p><p>One straightforward way to get this to work is to accept UFS partitions for DragonFly, loading the DragonFly kernel directly using GRUB. However, one of the attractions of DragonFly is its filesystem HAMMER, and unfortunately, unlike UFS, GRUB does not understand HAMMER.</p><p>The automatic installer installs DragonFly to one slice with three partitions. A small boot partition of type UFS, a swap partition, and the rest of type HAMMER. HAMMER allows for a series of pseudofilesystems, which incorporate the classic UNIX <code>/var</code>, <code>/usr</code> <code>/home</code> (and so on). This is the setup I wanted to achieve. However, the automatic installer doesn’t work with GPT format partition tables.</p><h2 id=proceed-with-installations>Proceed with installations</h2><p>First I installed Arch. The Arch documentation is good and suffices for the install. Its worth noting that despite using GPT, my system was running a BIOS, and not the more modern UEFI. I haven’t tested this with UEFI, and I don’t have a machine to try it with (which I’m willing to risk). Arch is easy to use to partition the drive with GPT, and a small (1MB) partition can be added at the start to install GRUB to for BIOS/GPT compatibility. The Arch documentation makes it clear how to do this. Of course, leave space for the DragonFly installation. I left ~70GB at the end of the drive.</p><p>Next install DragonFly. This must proceed manually, because the automatic installer won’t work for GPT. An invaluable guide which I initially overlooked is the readme file. Drop a directory (cd ..) and then you’ll find it – more README. This gives you a guide to manual installation. This and reading the man files ought to get you through the install, but here are a few notes. The entire process is not particularly complicated, and is not unlike installing Arch. There are a few differences, and its worth reading around the process a bit to familiarise yourself.</p><p>Add your DragonFly slice where you want it using the gpt tool (“man gpt” for details). You might need to feed it the start block (and possibly other parameters) to get it in the right place, because with GPT the first bit of free space is a tiny slot at the start of the disk. You just need one slice. Partitions of this will do the rest.</p><p>My DragonFly slice was the sixth GPT slice, so DragonFly names that da0s5. I’ll use this below. Adjust as necessary for your setup.</p><p>Don’t install <code>boot0</code> (no <code>boot0cfg</code> commands!), but do install bootblocks to the slice with:</p><pre><code>disklabel64 -B da0s5
</code></pre><p>This installs boot1/boot2 to the start of the slice. This is essential for chainloading, because GRUB will pass control to these boot blocks.</p><p>The disklabel was set to mimic that of the automatic installer, an <code>a</code> partition mounted <code>/boot</code> of type <code>UFS</code> (in the label BSD4.2), <code>b</code> of type swap, and <code>d</code> of type HAMMER, mounted as <code>/</code>. I essentially mimicked the arrangement found here: <a href=https://www.dragonflybsd.org/docs/newhandbook/environmentquickstart/#index2h2>https://www.dragonflybsd.org/docs/newhandbook/environmentquickstart/#index2h2</a>. The README file and disklabel manual should suffice to set this up.</p><p>Then format your partitions, mount them (as per README), and create the pseudofilesystems (PFSs), and mount them. cpdup everything in to place and tidy up.</p><p>Editing the example fstab file proved to be hassle with a tempermental vi, so I wrote one from scratch, mimicking that displayed in: <a href=https://www.dragonflybsd.org/docs/newhandbook/environmentquickstart/#index2h2>https://www.dragonflybsd.org/docs/newhandbook/environmentquickstart/#index2h2</a> (look for the <code>cat /etc/fstab</code> output – personally, however, I chose to softlink <code>/var/tmp</code> to <code>/tmp</code> also – the README here has a mistake, it links <code>/mnt/var/tmp</code> to <code>/tmp</code> instead of <code>/mnt/tmp</code> – this would create a link to the install media!).</p><p>The instructions will ask you to reboot. You can if you like. It is easy to boot back in to the install media and make the changes to get the system to boot. You won’t need drives mounted. One thing you might like to do is attempt chainloading in the current state (use the GRUB configuration detailed below), and confirm you get “Boot Error” as your error message. The following trick will fix this.</p><p>Tricking <code>boot1</code> – making your system boot</p><p>Now for the trick. If we were to chainload <code>(hd0, gpt6)</code>, which is GRUBs view of <code>da0s5</code>, we would get a “Boot Error” from <code>boot1</code>. This is because <code>boot1</code> looks for an MBR, and then looks for a BSD partition, from which it tries to boot. At the moment it won’t find DragonFly, because its slice is recorded in the GPT, which <code>boot1</code> does not understand.</p><p>However, if <code>boot1</code> was finding no MBR, it would return a “Read Error” (one needs to read the source code to discover this). So <code>boot1</code> must find an MBR. Where? In fact GPT specifies the existence of a “Protective MBR” for compatibility with MBR and BIOS systems. This is what <code>boot1</code> finds. You can view this (from the install media) with:</p><p><code>fdisk da0</code></p><p>This should show you the contents of the protective MBR, and it should show you the slice one is the entire disk, and the rest (2-4) are unused. This is so MBR systems do not think there is free space on the disk, when in actual fact GPT is managing it. The protective MBR of course occupies the same position on the disk as a normal MBR.</p><p><code>boot1</code> needs no more information than where to find DragonFly. Furthermore, <code>boot2</code> makes use of the disklabel, and doesn’t use the information which <code>boot1</code> gathers from the MBR, so we can write entries to the protective MBR without fear of the effect of these entries propagating too far. There is also nothing to stop us writing overlapping entries to this MBR either, using fdisk for example. So what we do is add a new entry to the protective MBR, which points to the <code>da0s5</code>, so that <code>boot1</code> can find it, and begin booting the rest of the system.</p><p>First run <code>gpt show da0</code>, and note down the start block and size (in blocks) of your DragonFly slice. Now run “fdisk -u da0”, leaving the first slice as is, but updating the second slice to be of type <code>165</code> (BSD’s type, and the one boot1 is looking for), and enter the start block you noted down, and also the size. Leave 3 and 4 unaltered and write this to the table. You can now chainload!</p><p>With this modification, <code>boot1</code> reads the protective MBR and finds an entry pointing to DragonFly (as if DragonFly were installed on a genuine MBR). This is enough to kickstart the system. Since the kernel has GPT compatibility, it sees the DragonFly partition as da0s5 as it should on a genuine GPT system. In fact, once boot1 has done its work, the rest of the system loads as if it were booted directly from the GPT format partition table.</p><p>Of course, if the GPT slice for DragonFly is moved, the protective MBR also requires updating. GPT compatibility of the bootloader is a much more desirable solution, but this is a simple and usable workaround for now. luxh on #dragonflybsd has pointed out that the tool “gptsync” can be used to help synchronise entries from the GPT with the MBR. Presumably, other people have used similar tricks elsewhere!</p><p>GRUB2 configuration</p><p>Just to be clear, my GRUB configuration file (<code>/etc/grub.d/40_custom</code>), has as entry</p><pre><code>menuentry “DragonFly BSD” {

setroot=(hd0,gpt6)

chainloader +1

}
</code></pre><p>A standard chainloader configuration. Install with <code>grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg</code>, from linux, or wherever it’s installed (<code>update-grub</code> if you are using *buntu).</p><h2 id=acknowlegments>Acknowlegments</h2><p>Thanks goes to the members of the #dragonflybsd irc channel for helping me eliminate possible causes of booting issues, providing insight into the current limitations of the boot system, and providing some encouragement for finding this solution.</p></div></section></div><div class=footer><div class="pure-menu pure-menu-horizontal pure-menu-open"><ul><li>Powered by <a class=hugo href=https://gohugo.io/ target=_blank>hugo</a></li></ul></div></div><script src=https://rlupton20.github.io/js/all.min.js></script></div></div></div><script>(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)})(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');ga('create','UA-109154579-1','auto');ga('send','pageview');</script></body></html>
