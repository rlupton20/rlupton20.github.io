It provides the core features you need from a virtual terminal without being a bloated mess. While I like <code>urxvt</code>, <code>st</code> is smaller, simpler and a touch faster. Like most suckless tools, <code>st</code> provides a minimal feature set, with the expectation that users will patch in additional features as wanted, or compose <code>st</code> with other tools (e.g. <code>dmenu</code>) to provide a more complex experience. This approach may seem a bit spartan to many - editing C for configuration isn&rsquo;t the most friendly interface - but what you get is solid, easy to understand, and is very hackable. I use it on my systems because I like its minimalism.</p><h1 id=getting-the-source-and-building>Getting the source and building</h1><p>To build <code>st</code> you&rsquo;ll need a few libraries for building X applications, in particular <code>libX11</code>.
None of the following is surprising - clone the source, read the <code>README</code>, adjust as needed, build and install.</p><h2 id=getting-the-source-and-basic-build>Getting the source and basic build</h2><p>Clone the source code directly from suckless.</p><pre><code>$ git clone https://git.suckless.org/st
</code></pre><p>Change directory into the source tree</p><pre><code>cd st
</code></pre><p>At this point, you may want to checkout the latest release tag (at time of writing it&rsquo;s <code>0.8.2</code>) with</p><pre><code>git checkout 0.8.2
</code></pre><p>I&rsquo;m happy building straight off master.</p><p>A simple build can be done by running</p><pre><code>$ make st
</code></pre><p>and the binary is emitted to the source directory. It can be tested with</p><pre><code>$ ./st
</code></pre><p>This is useful for testing customizations without installing system wide.</p><h2 id=system-wide-installation>System-wide installation</h2><p>The built binary can be installed system wide using</p><pre><code>$ sudo make clean install
</code></pre><h2 id=user-installation>User installation</h2><p>Alternatively, a user installation can be done by editing <code>config.mk</code>, changing the <code>PREFIX</code> variable to, e.g. <code>~/.local/</code> (assuming <code>~/.local/bin</code> is on your path).</p><pre><code class=language-Makefile>PREFIX = ~/.local
</code></pre><p>then running</p><pre><code>$ make clean install
</code></pre><p>If you need manpages for <code>st</code>, then you will need to update your <code>MANPATH</code> to include <code>~/local/share/man</code>.
Be aware that the <code>st</code> manpage conflicts with the SCSI tape device manuals - you may want to rename the man page. Maybe you don&rsquo;t care.</p><p>You can also read the man pages by telling <code>man</code> about the local search path</p><pre><code>$ man -M ~/.local/share/man st
</code></pre><h1 id=customization>Customization</h1><p>Customization of <code>st</code> is usually done through editing the C files. I find it works pretty well out of the box (with <code>tmux</code> used from scrollback etc). Basic settings can be changed in the <code>config.h</code> configuration header file.</p><p>Further customization can be achieved by editing the C source code directly. The <code>st</code> webpage has a collection of <a href=https://st.suckless.org/patches/>patches</a> from other users which can be applied to add new features. I find the default setup pretty much good to go - all I do usually is tweak the font size a little in <code>config.h</code>.</p><p>A <code>git</code> branch is useful for managing a collection of customizations. Changes can be rebased onto newer (or older) <code>st</code> versions, and new patch files can be generated using <code>git diff</code>.</p></div><div id=footer><a href=https://github.com/rlupton20><img class=nav-icon src=https://rlupton20.github.io/icons/github.svg></a></div></body></html>
