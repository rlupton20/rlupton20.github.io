It&rsquo;s not obvious that this is a valuable thing to aim for. Indeed, working hard to make code read like English is often pointless, or even counterproductive, in a variety of situations.</p><p>To begin with, English is very imprecise, a quality computers don&rsquo;t grant much tolerance for. Clarity and precision is often not a function of how the code &ldquo;reads&rdquo;, but of the core structure and invariants that bind it together<sup class=footnote-ref id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1>1</a></sup>. Attention is better spent, in the spirit of <em>via negativa</em>, removing what is not necessary to reduce a problem to it&rsquo;s core. This is all the more necessary for problems of performance and robustness which can often be hard to get correct. In some sense, the aim here is to elevate <em>why</em> something works above <em>how</em> - the expression of the precise implementation is often not all that interesting.</p><p>Instead aim for clarity by structure<sup class=footnote-ref id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2>2</a></sup>. Structure should emphasize correctness and efficiency, and make it clear why a problem is solved.</p><div class=footnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1>Solving problems in Haskell often leads to clear solutions. I think this is because functional programming in general is designed to describe precisely the structure of computation.
